+ monitor the loss durin the training
  + try different features to see which is has more impact
  + divide the training in many peroid. Each period, we calculate the RMSE(loss). Plot a loss curve to make sure the
    loss decreases and eventually become flat.
  + adjust batch size, learning rate, steps
+ synthentic features if your sense correlations
+ use histogram to remove outlier. You discount outlier
